topic: Building a gem5 configuration script
description: gem5 consists of various simobjects such as Clock, Interrupt controller, Cache etc, which can be used to create a system. This simobjects are written in C++ 
description: To create a System we need to build a configuration script in python. So gem5 uses python to call the simObject and simObjects are written in C++ which makes its operational faster and customizable.
description: We will build a configuration system like this:
image: "./simpleconfig.png"
subtopic: Create a configuration script
description: Create a new file with py extension Ex. simple.py. I have created a new directory named myScripts under configs folder
description: Type in terminal 
code: mkdir configs/myScripts
gedit configs/myScripts/simple.py
step: Import m5 library
code: import m5
from m5.objects import *
step: Create a system object
description: We are selecting riscv system object
code: system = System()

step: Setup a clock domain
description: We will create a clock_domain system object and give default voltage with frequency of 1GHz 
code: system.clk_domain=SrcClockDomain()
system.clk_domain.clock = '1GHz'
system.clk_domain.voltage_domain=VoltageDomain()

step: Setup memory mode
description: We will memory of 512Mb operating in timing mode
code: system.mem_mode='timing'
system.mem_ranges= [AddrRange('512MB')]
step: Create a CPU
description: We are using the TimingSimpleCPU simObject. There are other CPU objects too such as AtomicSimple, O3, In-Order
code: system.cpu= TimingSimpleCPU()
step: Create a memory bus
description: create a memory bus for connection between CPU and memory controller
code: system.membus = SystemXBar()
step: Connect membus to CPU
description: We are connecting CPU to membus using icache and dcache port which will be used later to install cache simObject between them
code: system.cpu.icache_port=system.membus.slave
system.cpu.dcache_port=system.membus.slave 
step: Create an Interrupt controller
code: system.cpu.createInterruptController()
system.system_port=system.membus.slave
step: Create a memory controller
code: system.mem_ctrl = DDR3_1600_8x8()
system.mem_ctrl.range=system.mem_ranges[0]
system.mem_ctrl.port=system.membus.master
step: Create a process
description: Create a process and give command to process to denote which object file to run. Currently for 
this case we will be using test-progs named hello world. Add this process as workload to the system and create threads
code: process =Process() 
process.cmd=['tests/test-progs/hello/bin/riscv/linux/hello']
system.cpu.workload= process 
system.cpu.createThreads()
step: Create a root object and instantiate m5 object to run the simulation
code: root=Root(full_system=False, system=system)
m5.instantiate()
print("Beginning Simulation...")
exit_event=m5.simulate()
print("Exiting @ tick {} because {}".format(m5.curTick(),exit_event.getCause()))

subtopic: Run the script
description: To run the python script type this in command line in the gem5 directory
code: build/RISCV/gem5.opt configs/myScripts/simple.py
